JIRA River Plugin for ElasticSearch
===================================

The JIRA River Plugin allows index [Atlassian JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) issues and issue comments into [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org). It's implemented as ElasticSearch [river](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/river/) [plugin](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/modules/plugins.html) and uses [JIRA REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+APIs) to obtain issus from JIRA instance.

**This plugin is in very early alpha phase of development, not functional yet!!**

In order to install the plugin into ElasticSearch, simply run: `bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-jira/1.0.0`.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | JIRA Plugin    | ElasticSearch    | JIRA version | JIRA REST API version |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | master         | 0.19 -> master   | 5+           | 2                     |
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JIRA river indexes JIRA issues and comments, and makes it searchable by ElasticSearch. JIRA is pooled periodically to detect changed issues (search operation with JQL query over `updatedDate` field) to update search index.

Creating the JIRA river can be done using:

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_jira_river/_meta -d '
	{
	    "type" : "jira",
	    "jira" : {
	        "urlBase"             : "https://issues.jboss.org",
	        "username"            : "jira_username",
	        "pwd"                 : "jira_user_password",
	        "timeout"             : 5000,
	        "maxIndexingThreads"  : 1,
	        "maxIssuesPerRequest" : 50,
	        "projectKeysIndexed"  : "ORG,AS7",
	        "projectKeysExcluded" : "ORG,IOP",
	        "indexUpdatePeriod"   : 5
	    },
	    "index" : {
	        "index" : "my_jira_index"
	    }
	}
	'

The above lists all the options controlling the creation of a JIRA river. 
* `jira/urlBase` is required in order to connect to the JIRA REST API. It's only base URL, path to REST API is added automatically.
* `jira/username` and `jira/pwd` are optional JIRA login credentials. Anonymous JIRA access is used if not provided.
* `jira/timeout` defines timeout for http/s REST request to the JIRA [ms]. Optional parameter.
* `jira/maxIndexingThreads` defines maximal number of parallel indexing threads running for this river. Optional, default 1. This setting influences load on both JIRA and ElasticSearch servers during indexing.
* `jira/maxIssuesPerRequest` defines maximal number of updated issues requested from JIRA by one REST request. Optional, 50 used if not provided. The maximum allowable value is dictated by the JIRA configuration property `jira.search.views.default.max`. If you specify a value that is higher than this number, your request results will be truncated to this number anyway.
* `jira/projectKeysIndexed` comma separated list of JIRA project keys to be indexed. Optional, list of projects is obtained from JIRA instance if ommited (so new projects are indexed automatically).
* `jira/projectKeysExcluded` comma separated list of JIRA project keys to be excluded from indexing if list is obtained from JIRA instance (so used only if no `jira/projectKeysIndexed` is defined). Optional.
* `jira/indexUpdatePeriod` period in minutes how ofter is search index updated from JIRA instance. Optional, default 5 minutes.
* `index/index` defines name of search index where JIRA issues are stored. Parameter is optional, name of river is used if ommited.

TODO List
---------
* Store values obtained from JIRA into ElasticSearch index, document search index structure
* Configurable list of additional JIRA issue fields indexed (some basic fields as Project Key, Issue Key, Reporter, Assignee, Status, Type, Created, Updated, Summary and Description indexed by default)
* JIRA issue delete indexing (incrementa over all issue keys list comparation with configurable checking period, or full reindex in configured period)
* Implement some mechanism to allow mapping of some issue fields (Project, Reporter, Assignee, Status, Type, ...) to common set of values shared with other document types or other issue trackers to integrate them into search frontent GUI.
* Implement some mechanism which allows to initiate full reindex of all issues (calleable over REST)
* Implement some mechanism which allows to initiate full reindex of all issues for defined JIRA project (calleable over REST)
* Implement REST endpoint where you can monitor status of JIRA river (which projects are indexed by river, which projects are indexed just now, last time of indexing run for projects etc.)
* Credentials for http proxy authentication used for JIRA REST calls
